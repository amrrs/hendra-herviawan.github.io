      <description>M Hendra Herviawan  Project Overview According to wikipedia.org, “RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value”.
RFM stands for the three dimensions:
 Recency – How recently did the customer purchase? Frequency – How often do they purchase? Monetary Value – How much do they spend?  The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).</description>
